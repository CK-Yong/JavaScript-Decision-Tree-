JavaScript implementation of a decision tree.

The application first asks the user a question. Depending on the answer that is received, a subsequent question is asked. Ultimately, the app tries to deduce the exact tree that is being described based on the answers given. 

The application reads in the file beforehand, where the entire base of questions can be found.
